              <h2>A Quick Introduction</h2>
              <p>I am the best friend of Sarah Rose Lyons and the father of our two sons, Emerson and Brooks. We moved our family from Dallas, TX to Greenville, SC a year ago with the goal of finding a career path that would offer me the opportunity to be challenged, to create and to take care of my family. </p>
              <p>In April 2014 I graduated from <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/" target="_blank">The Iron Yard Academy</a> where I learned the skills needed to become an excellent front-end developer. My hope is to combine my newly acquired programming skills with my experience in cross-cultural leadership, communication and customer service to add a diversity of value to the company and/or clients for whom I work.</p>
              <p>When I'm not sharpening my skills on the front end, you'll likely find me in my kitchen cooking a favorite meal, outdoors enjoying the mountains of Western North Carolina or the beaches around Charleston, or exploring my favorite craft beers or a new bottle of wine.</p>

              </ul>
              <p class="hidden-what-i-learned js-hidden-learned-wfm">My career with Whole Foods Market was a time of rapid personal and professional growth. I quickly advanced from a front end team member to Specialty Team Leader, and championed excellent customer service skills each step of the way. My natrual inclination toward great food and strong leadership capabilities went a long way to propel my opportunities. I enjoyed working for a company with a bold mission and an innovative vision. Ultimately, I came to realize that a career in retail management was not for me. The inconsistency of scheduling and lack of time off around holidays became a major interruption to my personal and family goals. In December of 2012 I left my job in order to spend the holiday with my family, resting and re-evaluating my long-term goals.

                <p class="hidden-what-i-learned js-hidden-learned-hgm">My career with HGM was a strange mix of fascination and frustration. On the one hand, I had the opportunity to travel to India and spend six months teaching in a school for abandoned children. My view of the world was forever altered by the stories of the people of India. I returned home with the goal of thinking strategically toward meeting the needs of underpriveleged children throughout the world, and was given the opportunity to do so under the umbrella of HGM's mission. Soon thereafter, the organization experienced a series of setbacks, and ultimately there was little to no support available for the department I was building. Despite this, my experiences were extremely valuable as I learned so much about the needs of people throughout the world, about cross-cultural leadership, and about persevering through times of great personal difficulty.

                <p class="hidden-what-i-learned js-hidden-learned-cc">My degree plan at Criswell College was primarily research based. I learned a great deal about the art of communication as the majority of my assignments involved writing, and many were geared toward instruction and public speaking. Through extracurricular activities such as leading mission teams and staying involved in the lives of youth in the local church, I learned the art of dealing with people, motivating and inspiring groups toward action, and teaching and instruction.
